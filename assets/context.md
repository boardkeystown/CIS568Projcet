# About:

This data visualization tool allows you to explore <i>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</i> and <i>Human Height</i> throughout the world. The data extent is from 1960 to 1998. 

You are uniquely able to gain insight on these two seemingly unrelated unrelated metrics.

This tool enables you learn what questions need to be asked as to the the "why" the data shows what it does. E.g., Why does height of people go down in country while GDP goes up or vice versa?
